# Chatbot with Memory using LangChain

This project demonstrates the development of a chatbot with memory capabilities using [LangChain](https://langchain.com). The chatbot is designed to remember context from previous conversations, enabling it to provide more relevant and consistent responses based on user input.

## Features
- **Contextual Memory**: The chatbot can recall previous conversations to provide context-aware responses.
- **Customizable Memory Length**: Define how much history the bot should retain.
- **Supports Multiple Integrations**: Use different LLMs or APIs for backend processing.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new capabilities such as search, document retrieval, or integrations with external services.

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain**: For creating and managing conversational chains and memory.
- **Python**: The primary language for backend development.
- **Streamlit**: Used for a user-friendly web interface (optional).
- **Hugging Face**: For integrating LLM models (or OpenAI/Grok for other models).
- **Docker** (optional): Containerize the chatbot for deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- API keys for your chosen LLMs (e.g., GoogleApiKEY, Hugging Face,Ollama)
